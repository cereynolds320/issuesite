    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    
<p>Book Buddies has been serving the children of Macon County for 6 years. Our team is dedicated to bringing the gift of reading to local children of all backgrounds by providing books and creating both in-person and digital material to be used in conjunction with books to make kids excited about reading. Our organization’s programs keep kids interested in reading and offer kids a space to learn without pressure.</p>

    <h1>How We Help</h1>
    
        <p>Book Buddies organizes regular book drives and donates books twice per school year to Macon County schools. We also organize for volunteers to spend time with children, both reading to them and allowing the kids to read. On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">our YouTube account,</a> we post videos that accompany donated children’s books that stimulate children’s minds and make them want to keep reading. It’s easy for children to become discouraged when learning to read, and Book Buddies aims to prevent this by ensuring every child has people and digital content to inspire them to keep trying.</p>

    <p>Book Buddies donates on average <b>4,000 books per year.</b> Our in-person reading programs have led to <b>increased reading and writing test scores</b> in local schools. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Our YouTube channel</a> has <b>3,000 subscribers and counting,</b> and local educators use our content in the classroom to inspire children to keep reading.</p>
